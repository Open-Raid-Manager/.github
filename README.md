# Open Raid Manager



After the latest race to world First dominated by the usual suspects it came to mind that a lot of raid performance these days is down to the developers working for these guilds.
Now I'm aiming to get these tools into the hands of your everyday gamers. I've just started coding and there is still a lot of work to do. But the first steps have been set and some success has been made.
